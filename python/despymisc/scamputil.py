    """
    Function to take an .ahead (for SCAMP) and splits only those individual 
    HDUs/elements that correspond to CCDs requested.

    Inputs: 
    infile:  an ASCII file (typically and .ahead with WCS header descriptions 
             for all possible HDUs)

    outfile: an ASCII file containing only those HDUs of the infile that
             are specified to be included by ccdlist

    ccdlist: an integer list of HDUs to include in the outfile

    If the keyword CCDNUM is present in HDU components of the infile then these 
    will override how each element in the .ahead file is given.  This provides the
    ability to have an empty/missing element but to maintain ordering.

    If a requested element is missing then a non-zero return code is given.
    This case is checked for before the output file is written
