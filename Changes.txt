== 0.1.0 
Initial version. Relocated all of the misc and python-only code from
the old despyutils package

== 0.2.0 
added to despymisc/python the following modules:
      
- http_requests.py -- by Michael Graber, to transfer/get files via
  http/https using the credential stored in the $USER/.desservices.ini
  file
- subprocess_utils.py, a set of simple functions to call subprocess.call()

== 0.2.1
- changes to http_requests.py, the authentication process is now done
  the function level and not inside the scope
- Now the __init__ function does not pre-load all of the modules. This
  was unnecessary.

== 0.2.2
- Fix the call to fwsplit inside split_ahead_by_ccd.py


== 0.2.3
- Moved subprocess_utils.py to multiprocess.utils.py 
- minor changes to http_requests.py
